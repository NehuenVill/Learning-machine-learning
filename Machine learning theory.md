# Machine learning

## What's machine learning?

It's a subdomain of computer science that focuses on creating algorithms that help computers learn form excisting data to take certain actions without the need of a programmer telling the computer what to do.

## What is AI?

Artificial intelligence, the goal is to make computers able to perform or simulate human behavior.
Machine learning is an AI branch.

## What's Data science?

Field that works toward finding patterns and draw conclusions from data.

# Types of machine learning

## Supervised learning

Here you give labeled inputs to your computer, which have a certain output.
With a huge amount of these inputs you train your computer to predict the next output based on the input.

The inputs info are called feature vectors.

### Types of features:

1. Qualitative: categorical data, there are a certain number of categories or groups (i.e. Eye colors, gender, and so on).

There's _nonimal data_ which means there's no inherent order in the different parts of the categories or groups.

To feed your model with this type of data you normally use the _one-hot encoding_ method.

And there's _ordinal data_ which means there's an order in the different parts of the categories or groups (i.e. age groups, test scores/grades).

To feed your model with this type of data you normally give a number/value ascendingly to each one of the parts of the category.

2. Quantitative: Data which value is numerical (length, temperature), there's continuous and discrete types.

### Supervised learning tasks:

1. Classification: To predict discrete classes.There's multiclass classification (where there are more than one class i.e dog breeds) and binary classification (Where there's only two classes i.e. Spam/not Spam, positive or negative).

2. Regression: To predict continuous values.

## unsupervised learning

Here we use unlabeled data to discover patterns in it.

## Reinforcement learning

Here the machine learns in an interactive environment, based on rewards and penalties.
