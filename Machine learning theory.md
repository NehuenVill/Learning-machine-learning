# Machine learning

## What's machine learning?

It's a subdomain of computer science that focuses on creating algorithms that help computers learn form excisting data to take certain actions without the need of a programmer telling the computer what to do.

## What is AI?

Artificial intelligence, the goal is to make computers able to perform or simulate human behavior.
Machine learning is an AI branch.

## What's Data science?

Field that works toward finding patterns and draw conclusions from data.

# Types of machine learning

## Supervised learning

Here you give labeled inputs to your computer, which have a certain output.
With a huge amount of these inputs you train your computer to predict the next output based on the input.

## unsupervised learning

Here we use unlabeled data to discover patterns in it.

## Reinforcement learning

Here the machine learns in an interactive environment, based on rewards and penalties.
